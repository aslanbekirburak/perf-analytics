# Perf-Analytics

  - I create a database with Postgres.I open my Db on my google trial server and open db with docker
  - To show performance issues i used react-svg-line-chart to draw charts because it is light-weighted.
  - To mesaure performace issues i used window-performance built-in functions
  - In my test scenario Fcp gets 0 because there is no media to measure
  - On React side i used scss for styling especially for responsiveness
  - For api connection i use express.js
